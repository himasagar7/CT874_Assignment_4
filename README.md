Programming I Assignment 4
1.Write an application that allows the user to enter a Fahrenheit temperature and displays the Celsius equivalent or enter a Celsius temperature and displays the Fahrenheit equivalent. The application should include a Celsius method which returns the Celsius equivalent of a Fahrenheit temperature using the following calculation;
celsius = 5.0/9.0 * (Fahrenheit - 32);
The application should also include a Fahrenheit method, which returns the Fahrenheit equivalent of a Celsius temperature using the following calculation;
fahrenheit = 9.0/5.0 * celsius + 32;

2.A car park charges a €5.00 minimum to park for up to three hours. The car park charges an additional €1.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three hours.
